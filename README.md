# BTT_Final_ML_Project
As a part of Cornell University's Break Thru Tech program, I was allowed to explored an "The World Happiness" dataset using libraries such as Sci-Kit learn, Numpy, Pandas, and TensorFlow to train a model that best fit a problem I chose. After testing different models, I ended up with a multiple linear regression model.
